# trip-advisor-review-ann

In this notebook, I will be working on the Trip Advisor Hotel Review dataset.

First of all, I will make some exploratory data analysis for the features and the texts as well. Consequently, I will proceed with cleaning the data by leveraging the NLTK library (The Natural Language Toolkit, or more commonly NLTK, is a suite of libraries and programs for symbolic and statistical natural language processing for English written in the Python programming language.)

Next, I will create an ANN model to achieve my aim with the use of Keras module which is built on top of TensorFlow and provides us all the functionality to create a variety of neural network architectures. Weâ€™ll use the Sequential class in Keras to build our model and be able to predict if based on some review, the writer would not only recommend the hotel or not but also predict it the rating will be good.
