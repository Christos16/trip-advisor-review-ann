# trip-advisor-review-ann

In this notebook, I will be working on the Trip Advisor Hotel Review dataset.

First of all, I will make some exploratory data analysis for the features and the texts as well. Consequently, I will proceed with cleaning the data by leveraging the NLTK library (The Natural Language Toolkit, or more commonly NLTK, is a suite of libraries and programs for symbolic and statistical natural language processing for English written in the Python programming language.)

Next, I will create an ANN model to achieve my aim.
